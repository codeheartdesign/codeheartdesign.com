      **Creating Cultures of Empathy**

      The most successful endeavors all follow the same general trajectory:
      a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers.
      No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline.
      But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems, and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies
      fail.
      That thing is us.
      People.
      But when we’re at our best, there isn’t anything we can’t do.
      So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don’t see eye to eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a
      culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?

      Sharon Steed explores empathy in an unusual way:
      from the perspective of a stutterer.
      Sharon explains what empathy is (and what it isn’t) and gives you the tools you need to create a culture of empathy on your team.

      **Sketching in the Browser**

      Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry.
      To tackle this problem, we're beginning to see the emergence of a new breed of code-powered design tooling, providing a true feedback loop from
      development back into design.
      In this talk, we'll run through a real-world example of how we generated a shared Sketch library from our React-based design system, have a closer look at
      how it all works, and show how you can start experimenting with this technique yourself.
