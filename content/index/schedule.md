  # #     **Creating Cultures of Empathy**

  # #     The most successful endeavors all follow the same general trajectory:
  # #     a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers.
  # #     No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline.
  # #     But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems, and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies
  # #     fail.
  # #     That thing is us.
  # #     People.
  # #     But when we’re at our best, there isn’t anything we can’t do.
  # #     So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don’t see eye to eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a
  # #     culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?

  # #     Sharon Steed explores empathy in an unusual way:
  # #     from the perspective of a stutterer.
  # #     Sharon explains what empathy is (and what it isn’t) and gives you the tools you need to create a culture of empathy on your team.

  #     **10 Rules for a Successful Product or How To Work With Developers and Designers**

  #     Delivering a successful product is easy:
  #     mix two parts empathy with one part innovation, shake well and garnish with the JavaScript framework of your choice.
  #     Job's done! Or so you thought.
  #     You probably need someone to design your product.
  #     And someone to bring those designs to life.
  #     Working with designers and developers doesn't need to be the nightmare you're imagining.
  #     Listen in as I share my experience as a product manager, conveniently distilled into 10 rules for delivering a successful product.

  # #     **Accessibility in Design systems - the pain and glory**

  # #     Building a design system is a painful enough, but how do you add accessibility into the mix?
  # #     Is it an "up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege", or can it become part of the normal work flow.
  # #     We'll look at accessibility for different roles - such as UX, UI and devs, as well as where accessibility should be injected into the process.

  # #     Russ Weakley has worked in the design field for over 20 years as a Design System Architect, User Experience professional, Front-end Developer and trainer.
  # #     He is the producer and presenter of 12 video courses on CSS and Responsive Web Design and is passionate about accessibility and web standards.

  # #     **Sketching in the Browser**

  # #     Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry.
  # #     To tackle this problem, we're beginning to see the emergence of a new breed of code-powered design tooling, providing a true feedback loop from
  # #     development back into design.
  # #     In this talk, we'll run through a real-world example of how we generated a shared Sketch library from our React-based design system, have a closer look at
  # #     how it all works, and show how you can start experimenting with this technique yourself.
