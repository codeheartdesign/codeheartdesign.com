  #     **Creating Cultures of Empathy**

  #     The most successful endeavors all follow the same general trajectory:
  #     a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers.
  #     No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline.
  #     But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems, and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies
  #     fail.
  #     That thing is us.
  #     People.
  #     But when we’re at our best, there isn’t anything we can’t do.
  #     So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don’t see eye to eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a
  #     culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?

  #     Sharon Steed explores empathy in an unusual way:
  #     from the perspective of a stutterer.
  #     Sharon explains what empathy is (and what it isn’t) and gives you the tools you need to create a culture of empathy on your team.

      **10 Rules for a Successful Product**<br>
      or How To Work With Developers and Designers

      Delivering a successful product is easy:
      mix two parts empathy with one part innovation, shake well and garnish with the JavaScript framework of your choice.
      Job's done! Or so you thought.
      You probably need someone to design your product.
      And someone to bring those designs to life.
      Working with designers and developers doesn't need to be the nightmare you're imagining.
      Listen in as I share my experience as a product manager, conveniently distilled into 10 rules for delivering a successful product.

      Modern web app architecture, whichever framework you use, focuses on separation of concerns and reusability.
      The current trend towards design systems feeds into this logic, abstracting a highly reusable presentational layer.

      Design is Atomic; code is neatly separated into presentational and container components.
      But what happens when these different paradigms meet in the middle? Should the app architecture be influenced by Atomic principles? How do we represent
      state changes in the design system?

      We’ll look at a few problems that might pop up when applying these principles to a real world product (especially when working to tight deadlines) and
      share a few tips on how to avoid pitfalls and build a clean, scalable codebase, all while staying on speaking terms with the design team.

  #     It’s wild how much JavaScript has learned from CSS over the years.
  #     Need to target a DOM element?
  #     CSS Selectors have you covered!
  #     Declarative code?
  #     That was CSS long before it was React.
  #     So as we boldly put our CSS in our JS and step into the component age, let’s take a look at some other lessons we can learn from the design language of
  #     the web.

  #     **Accessibility in Design systems - the pain and glory**

  #     Building a design system is a painful enough, but how do you add accessibility into the mix?
  #     Is it an "up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege", or can it become part of the normal work flow.
  #     We'll look at accessibility for different roles - such as UX, UI and devs, as well as where accessibility should be injected into the process.

  #     Russ Weakley has worked in the design field for over 20 years as a Design System Architect, User Experience professional, Front-end Developer and trainer.
  #     He is the producer and presenter of 12 video courses on CSS and Responsive Web Design and is passionate about accessibility and web standards.

  #     **Sketching in the Browser**

  #     Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry.
  #     To tackle this problem, we're beginning to see the emergence of a new breed of code-powered design tooling, providing a true feedback loop from
  #     development back into design.
  #     In this talk, we'll run through a real-world example of how we generated a shared Sketch library from our React-based design system, have a closer look at
  #     how it all works, and show how you can start experimenting with this technique yourself.

      **Build realistic prototypes, how to design with code and real data**

      Prototyping is a crucial step in the design process and yet practically nowhere to be found. We shouldn’t be surprised! The medium of choice by the vast
      majority of designers — Sketch, Figma, Invision — are terrible at building realistic, meaningful prototypes. What could go wrong when we try to validate
      our designs with illusions?

      The future doesn’t have to be like this. Standardization on component-based frameworks like React, growing adoption of design systems, technologies like
      GraphQL, and a slew of innovative, designer-focused tools that tie everything together, building realistic prototyping is finally within reach. Designers
      who make the leap into this world will find themselves empowered to create prototypes as an essential part of the design process.

      In this talk, we’ll dive deeper into the current state of prototyping and how tools are evolving to allow designers to prototype with code and real data!
