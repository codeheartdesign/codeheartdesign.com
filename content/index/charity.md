Code Heart Design supports the work of the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence (NCIE) a not-for-profit social enterprise where Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples can access opportunities to achieve excellence.
NCIE recognises and celebrates the existing and emerging strengths and assets in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.

Indigenous Digital Excellence (IDX) is an innovative digital skills development program at the NCIE that partners with Elders and children from Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander communities across Australia.
IDX covers a wide range of digital skills ranging from basic computer literacy through to advanced skills like piloting drones.
