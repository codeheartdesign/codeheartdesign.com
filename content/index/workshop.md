This half-day workshop explores the principles of empathy that foster the best, most  productive communication in individuals and on tech teams in the
workplace.
Participants will take part in interactive games, discussions, and activities to identify their communication strengths and weaknesses; learn the empathy
actions they already display and those that they need to incorporate into their daily lives for optimal communication; and how to approach all conversations
from a place of understanding.

**Objective and outcomes:**
- Participants will define what empathy is on their own terms, and theyâ€™ll understand how and why empathy is a benefit to any community or organization.
- Participants will develop a system of communication they can share with and teach their teams at work that is rooted in empathy principles.
- Participants will leave the workshop being more confident communicators; more understanding and prepared collaborators; and more engaged team members.

**Time:** 8.30 for a 9am start Nov 30th, on the morning of the conference

**Location:** Atlassian, Level 6, 341 George St, Sydney CBD
